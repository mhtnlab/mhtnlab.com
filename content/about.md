I started MHTN lab on the 5th of June, 2024 as a creative outlet for my study, and to hold myself accountable. Join me as I share all that I learn on this journey we call life. Consider this my way of giving back.

P.S. Shout out to Dennis Devey of [Roppers](https://www.roppers.org)! MHTN Lab would have not been possible without him or Roppers.
