Ever wonder how the internet works? Or where it all started?

Well, I'm not going to explain it to you...

> What's the point of this post then?

Matter of fact, I'm going to abstract away most of the history of communications. From its modest beginnings since we discovered the ability to speak to scientific breakthroughs in the world of physics - you'd spend a lifetime going through it all.

The point is, you want to know how the internet works and a little bit of its history. All the other complexities and nuances offered by the humanities and sciences can take a back-seat for now - though it does make for good reading.

*If it is something that interests you, you'll want to look into the history of electronics, radio waves, and harmonics*.

### Modest Beginnings

After the breakthroughs of the sciences in radio technology (Marconi, Bell, Tesla, Edison, and company - these are just a few honourable mentions), The Bell System conglomerate came out with the first telephone system. They would later build infrastructure to make this system feasible for business and home use.

### Bell Labs

*Current Day Nokia Bell Labs*

The advent of telephone communication required infrastructure for nation-wide communication to be feasible. Bell System spent its first few years advancing telephone communications and building infrastructure - this was when they came up with the idea of the **Bell Laboratory building** - remember this - it will come in handy later.

Over time, the research they were doing would go on to gain the interest of the military, the government, and capitalists. This is where you will find a connection to Grace Hopper. Yes, *__that__* Grace Hopper - *__the__* Grace Hopper - Rear Admiral Grace Brewster Hopper (n√©e Murray).

### Beyond Bell Labs

Their research went on, their infrastructure morphed, their technology evolved - leading to the Television demonstration at Bell Telephone Labs by Herbert Ives and Frank Gray. Point being, similar technologies were used to transmit telephone and television signals - a lot of cable and some radio waves.

Yes, yes, I know - I hand-waved away the advent of AM and FM radio and a whole lot more about broadcasts. You've likely already experienced AM and/or FM radio broadcasts.

The Bell System conglomerate would go on to monopolize the market until competitors showed up and they had their eventual downfall. Part of the Bell System company was acquired by AT&T - American Telephone and Telegraph Company - you probably already know this. Yes, they took over Bell Labs and the Bell Laboratory building. The culture had shifted so much in that short time, so much so that the word "Laboratory" was now being shortened to "Lab" in the populist mind.

### Going off on a Tangent (or should I say Parallel)
#### ABHOC - A brief history of computers

Under the direction of AT&T, Bell Labs would then make further contributions to the world of compute and technology. With Dennis Ritchie, Ken Thompson, Brian Kernighan, and Bjarne Stroustrup at the forefront. There's a whole history of operating systems and programming languages one can get into here - I leave that up to you.

Note that I skipped over a lot about other programming languages and integrated circuit & microprocessor.

Additionally, there is a whole other parallel history of computers and computer operating systems you can get into from here, perhaps I will write about this later.

However the jist of it is as follows: UNIX was a paid product that students could not afford, so brilliant hackers, researchers, and technologists built free alternatives like BSD and Linux. It's mostly Linus Torvalds who gets mainstream credit these days though. However, there is a whole other rabbithole about the FSF and Richard Stallman - but I will not get into that.

**If interested you can start with the following search terms: PDP-11, FORTAN, COBOL, BASIC, Multics, Unix, Minix, Linux, BSD, Plan V, Solaris, C, C++, Java, Intel 4004, Acorn Technologies, Acorn RISC macines, Advanced RISC Machines, MOSFETs, DEC, ARM, RISC-V, StrongARM, MIPS**

### The First Semblance of Computer Network Communication

Remember I mentioned the Military? They began their own R&D program, leading to the creation of the ARPANET. Academics soon followed - building their own networks and then bridges for internetwork communication. This is when the whole hacker scene started to take form - on PDP-11 machines, and later IBM machines.

Meanwhile, Europe, too had plans. CERN needed a way of centralizing their information and sharing research. Enter Sir Tim Bernes Lee. Another story you probably already know - the invention of the world wide web.

Then the internet is born. Corpos battle it out for internet supremacy in the browser wars. Microsoft takes over the world - through Bill's shrewd business sense - first by buying QDOS and then by building their network stack with "inspired" material from UNIX-land, espcially (BSD and Linux). Microsoft was also battling it out with Apple at the time - pretty sure you know this story, so not going to get into it.

Microsoft faces an injunction (Microsoft Anti-trust), Firefox takes over, then Google creates chrome and ends the browser wars. We also had a parallel war - the culture wars - since the advent of PBX systems, online bulletins, mailing lists, AOL, E-mail, Chatrooms, etc.

I also skipped a lot about Xerox, Apple, Darwin, NextStep, Xorg, desktop environments, Netscape, and the history of computer hardware and peripherals, the first computer virus - how it started as a joke, the creeper and the reaper. It's a very interesting history.

And here we are today - the internet we know and love.

Part II coming out soon. I'll discuss the technologies that make the internet work.

Look out for signalling system 7, fixed connections and more.
