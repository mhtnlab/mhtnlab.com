Alright, alright, alright! Now that you've got Git set up, it's time to git gud (*\*Cue sting\**).

> You're well on your way to becoming a dev 
>> That... minus the fact that I haven't shown you how to code yet, but hey, maybe you already know how to code. In which case, congratulations you have learned the basics of source code management.



Navigate to the root of the directory where you created your C project, and fire up a terminal window: 
- Git Bash if you're on Windows

Now type the following into your terminal window:

```
git init
```

You've created your first repo! Now get in there and start hacking.
