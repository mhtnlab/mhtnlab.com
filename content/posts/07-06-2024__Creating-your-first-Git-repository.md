Alright, alright, alright! Now that you've got Git set up, it's time to git gud (*\*Cue sting\**).

## *"You're well on your way to becoming a dev."*

This is where we chain the skills you've learned. Remember that [Hello World]() project we created in C? We're going to turn it into a Git repo.

Navigate to the root of the directory where you created your C project, and fire up a terminal window: 
- Git Bash if you're on Windows

Now type the following into your terminal window:

```
git init
```

You've created your first repo! Now get in there and start hacking.
