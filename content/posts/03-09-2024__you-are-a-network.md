Your entire body is a large system of multiple networks of subsystems that work together in order to keep you alive.

Take the brain, for example - it is the processing (compute (thinking)) center lf the brain. The brain itself is a system consisting of nodes that connect to each other. These nodes are called neurones. Together they form a neural network.

You could think of the brain as being one neural network. That is technically correct. However, as you perceive different stimuli, each of these stimuli follow distinct neural pathways. These pathways are generally the same certain typea of stimuli, respectively.

Each of these pathways can, then, also be considered as separate neural networks.

Sight, for example, starts with the stimulus - photons reach your eyes (from the spot you were looking at (focusing on) (reflected from their source)), then they reach your eyes (ocular hardware), your eyes do their thing (magnify and reflect light onto the retina (it reaches the retina upside down) where the rod and cone cells do their thing (primary shape and colour detection, note I did not use the word perception)) then the light travels along the optic nerve (very similar to optic fiber cables but biological (organic)), it then splits along four neural pathways, the light from the left field of vision from the both eyes takes the pathway that goes to the right cerebral hemisphere and the light from the right field of vision from both eyes takes the pathway that goes to the left cerebral hemisphere (a specific region in each respective hemisphere - these are image processing units - there are two main regions - one on the left hemisphere and one on the right - so you can say you have two image processors(these too consist of multiple neurones - forming a neural network in order to process the data)), then the vision is reconstructed and sent as a signal to the region of the brain that deals with perception and understanding, this is where you perceive all your senses (regardless of type) (processing happens elsewhere), this results in you being able to see.

1. Stimulus - light enters your eyes
2. Your eyes convert it into signals and sends them to the brain via four neural pathways.
3. Signals from these four neural pathways reach both the hemispheres.
4. Images are processed and reconstructed once sent to the perception center
5. You perceive the images

Look familiar? (Computer Science related majors should find this familiar). This is fundamental to machine learning.

It is a basic neural network.

Two layers we can see and understand - input and output
The rest are hiddeb layers.

The sight process can be looked at as having an equivalent neural network, however this is not correct. There's multiple different types of hardware along the way, but speaking purely from a Machine Learning perspective, this is right.

This network, then, consists of multiple sub-networks. Where other processing takes place for sub-components of sight (prerequisites for sight).

Similarly, sound, as a stimulus, follows a similar process, however, this time, instead of two processors, there is only one.

Humans have only one language processor. It is one of our greatest flaws. This is why you find yourself distracted and unable to do anything productive like writing a letter or studying for a test while listening to music. Your language processor is trying to process two stimuli of the same kind at once!

Oddly enough, this doesn't seem to happen if you're listening to music instead of listening to songs. As long as there's no words involved, your language processor will not also try to process the lyrics of a song while working on that letter your boss asked you to finish by 4 pm the next day (and it's already 3pm the next day and you have only one hour until the deadline).

Your language processor is located in the left hemisphere. When you are born, you don't have any understanding of language. This is something that becomes a part of you through learning and social conditioning.

This is why in infants the right hemisphere is dominant. It is my belief that the right hemisphere remains dominant until a certain point of development (around ages 8 to 12) - this is when children begin behaving more logically and also where logic develops exponentially - this goes on to make the left side of the brain the dominant side - not immediately of course.

Some of us manage to "survive" this process, largely leaving our right brains dominant. Those of us that "survive", display more artistic behaviours and a passion for the arts primarily.

This is also where neurodivergence happens. "Normal" people have a certain harmony between both their hemispheres. Neurodivergent people, however, tend to depend on one hemisphere more than the other. Neurodivergence caused by Down's Syndrome, usually causes the right brain to be more dominant. Which is why people with Down's Syndrome excel at the arts and making new friends (without even the ability to communicate properly sometimes!). Those on the autism spectrum however tend to be faster learners and display greater propensities for logical thinking (left brained).

There is also a case to be made for the dark triad, however I will not be exploring this.

Back to the topic of babies. When you are an infant, your right hemisphere is dominant. This, I believe, is where your subconscious resides - which is also probably what enables you to learn a language in the first place.

It's very similar to training a large language model, however a baby has a lot of information on how to develop that has been passed on through genetic inheritance. This is also probably what enables children to learn faster than machines.

Once yo've learned a language significantly well, it gives way to thought structure. Once your thoughts are structured, logic takes over exponentially - giving way to development of the left hemisphere. Which happens through social conditioning.

Of course social conditioning starts before language learning, but then way is made for a different tyoe if social conditioning through the use of language.

This is why you may sometimes think something but not be able to structure a thought. Possibly also why you forget things (again, one of my beliefs, but here we go - I believe short term memory is stored in the right hemisphere and long term memory in the left - because it is structured, symbolic).

This also why you have a dream, and then are unable to remember it.

I am going to stop here; abrupt, I know, but when I finish giving form to these thoughts, I will update this post.
