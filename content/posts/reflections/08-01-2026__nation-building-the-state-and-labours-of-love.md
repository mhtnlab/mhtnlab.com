# Nation Building, the State, and the X labours of Love

National pride is misplaced. Modern Patriotism is stupid, you're essentially placing your pride and trust in the State — the Government. This nationalistic pride is misplaced.

...In essence patriotism is fealty (devotion? slavery? respect? [sworn/pledged] allegiance?) to the state/to the regime. In essence, this is foolish. It is stupid...

I mean think about it. Truly, think about it...

What even is a Nation? What is Nationalism? What is Patriotism?

Do you even understand thr difference between the Nation and the State?

What even is a nation? If you give it some thought, you'll understand that a nation is a collective of peoples eother of the same genetic lineage or a marriage of genetic lineages—Peoples who have cone together and built a commune.

In the purist sense of it, the Nation refers to a homogeneous collective of people, either by the fact that they all share the same ancestry. More likely it is that their tribes came together and found similarities in each other and so cared for and respected one another. 

And so they merged and their people intermixed. They shared their triumphs and their sorrows and celebrated great achievements together.

In an ideal world they would mix 50-50, share their history and spoils and see each other as equals, however we know that this never happened. It is human nature for one tribe to be morr dominant than their counterpart.

But they still come together and form a mostly homogeneous bond with structured levels to their society, sharing common values and ancestry.

When nations and cultures war with each other, it is my understanding that this is never typically out of malice but instead out of misunderstanding and a feeling of other being so far removed from ones own culture that they are almost alien-otherified. 

This is imprinted into our genome. Think about that time you fell in love or were crushing on or were infatuated with someone. 


We'll never truly know our partners—explanation in a bit. Think about time you saw yourself in someone. You couldn't help but feel a magnetic/polarizing force of attraction... or perhaps even against your greater judgement an obsessive infatuation. We've all been there. It's even worse when its unrequited. Why? Because it feels like a loss, a death even-I might offer.

Remember, people like people who are like people. 

Psychologically this is because you feel like you've lost a part of yourself. Now it can never be, and so you start spiraling out of control.

That must have really gripped you—hauntingly beautiful, isn't it? 

Why is any of this relevant? Because nation building starts with the family, the tribe. It's a labour of love.

That's what a nation is meant to do-to grow as a labour of love, but what happens when we've outperformed our expectations and grown too fast. What happens when there's too many of us? What happens when there's so many natural born leaders who all want to lead? What happens if there is a conflict?

When a tribe or a nation becomes so large that a village or a family cannot effectively look after each other and resolve disputes, things become chaotic. So chaotic that the most intelligent in the hierarchy rise to the top and build systems of governance. Yes, violence is a necessary evil sometimes.

Natural selection at play here-the strongest, most intelligent people rise to the top work together and build systems to rise against chaos and bring order to their nations. And so they form a government-the state.

Over time, the state becomes more and more disconnected from its people, and in so doing, it loses sight of its original purpose-growth as a labour of love and prosperity for all. Over tine dominance structures form and privatize, leading to the creation of various political, religious ideology and of course businesses.

Once removed from their original purpose, power becomes their only purpose. Power for power's sake. And absolute power corrupts absolutely.

This is why our systems fail us—we lose sight of what is most important to us. 

What even is love? On one hand, it's a dance, a war of the wills, push and pull, it's almost hermetic - giving to receive, fighting for survival.

In its resonant form, it can also be nuturing, caring, a force for growth and life.

Both these aspects are in fact, true and cannot be separated. You cannot have the light with out the darkness. A shadow cannot be, in fact, cast if there wasn't a light projected onto the object whose form it captures. A coin is not a coin if it does not have both sides-heads and tails, neither is possible alone. And a more time honoured axiom, "One hand may not clap alone."

Modern societies seem to forget that a lone Wolf in a nature-is dead. A wolf cannot brave the winters alone, it will die without the pack.

Our forefathers and ancestors built their tribes in the service of their fellow man (yes, as a labour of love). We seem to have forgotten, or worse, willingly given up on this for more power and other representations of power in the modern age (wealth, money [not the same thing], clothes, precious metals and stones, fast cars, etc).

Some excuses you may have in mind:
But it's bad for business! - only if you're so focused on KPIs and making even greater profits that you can't see past the end of your own nose.

We won't make as much money from doing this - yeah, and? Society was formed as a vehicle for prosperity for all - this is why we have rules and everyone follows them. Our forefathers built our societies on the principle that everyone can be happy and that they each have their rights - we respect their rights, they respect ours or we both agreed to shared consequences for trangressing. Isn't this the basis to most of our laws, our philosophies, and heck-even religion?
