Alright, I've procrastinated long enough. I suppose it's time.

> I suppose you could say this article is about my 'security journey' or my 'deep dive into cyber' but I hate using that phrase - it holds no real meaning ('influencers' seem to have ruined it for me).

I took up learning about operating system internals and linux based operating shortly after Covid hit the world. This is is where it led.

### Custom Android ROMs, Kali and My Interest in Pentesting

There was a point in time where I had this fascination with getting devices to do what they aren't originally intended to do - this began when I discovered custom ROMs for android devices. 

At the time I was a student interested in getting into Cyber. I had a lot of time on my hands and my interest piqued when I learned, first-hand (don't ask me how), the privacy and security implications of using Big Tech.

I purchased and built quite the collection of mobile devices. From LineageOS to e OS and iode OS and other obscure custom ROMs - I tried them all.

It was then that I discovered alternative app stores and of course, termux and kali nethutner. Yes, I used an android device with termux installed as my daily driver for a while - never again.

I happened to get started with Kali Nethuter on a Nokia 6.1 at this time - I did not stick to it, with good reason of course:

1. It simply was not stable or ready for primetime
2. I had a lot more to learn

I also happened to be distro-hopping during this phase of my student life (eventually settling on debian and its derivatives for stability).

### Delving into Kali and the Linux Kernel

At first, I'd say I started off as the run-off-the-mill script kiddy. Crack into a Wi-Fi system here, run a bluetooth exploit there, eventually working my way up to OSINT and people intelligence.

I wanted to learn more, I wanted to learn all of it, and not just know it. No, no, I wanted to understand all of it (I'm still not there yet) and like any good story, this one stops abruptly and restarts a few good years later.

#### Fast Forward to Today >>>

I got Kali Linux working on a One Plus 6T, not without a few struggles though.

I no longer have this phone as I set it up for a friend who's clearly interested and looking to start a career in tech. I trust they will find it as great a learning experience I did.

From install troubles to having to wipe the device and start over, clean and then running into issues with apt, bluetooth and OTG - I learned a few things from how to boot into EDL mode and flash factory android images, rebuild linux device trees and rebuild a live kernel image. 

#### Write-ups incoming.
